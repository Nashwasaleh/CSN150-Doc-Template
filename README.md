## Steps I followed
1. Write the steps you followed here.  This way you can keep track of where you might have messed up if the project does not work. 

## Problems
Note your problems or errors here.  Google any error you may come across, and not what you tried (even if it does not work), and what was the final answer. Document your errors and solutions that worked for you.  

### Example Problem
1. Arduino code will not load on ESP32 Cam.
   Answer: Camera drivers were incorrect I needed to install the driver: [https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router).  I used file, "CH341SER.ZIP" and it worked.

# ESP32 Wi-Fi Scanner
## Name Nashwa Saleh 
## Documentation Followed I followed the GitHub Primer + Documentation video and the “Lecture Video - ESP32 Primer + Arduino” to get the project running. 
## Challenges Faced - Initially had trouble installing Git; resolved by downloading it from git-scm.com.
                    - Setting up the ESP32 in Arduino IDE required installing the ESP32 board manager and selecting the right COM port.
                    - Some serial monitor outputs didn’t show Wi-Fi networks at first; fixed by adjusting antenna position and re-uploading the sketch. 
## Description The ESP32 Wi-Fi Scanner scans nearby Wi-Fi networks and displays their SSIDs and signal strength (RSSI) on the Serial Monitor. This is useful for checking Wi-Fi coverage in an area, debugging IoT devices, and selecting the strongest network.
